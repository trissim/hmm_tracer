# HMM Tracer Project Development Plan

## Project Overview

The HMM Tracer project is focused on axon tracing in microscopy images using Hidden Markov Models. The project has been refactored into a proper Python package structure, and we're now planning to:

1. Set up GitHub repositories for version control
2. Integrate with your forked alvahmm package
3. Develop new features like cell body detection

## Current Status

1. The hmm_tracer project has been refactored into a modular structure
2. The code is organized into logical components with proper documentation
3. You have a fork of alvahmm at https://github.com/trissim/alvahmm
4. We need to connect these projects and continue development

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: GitHub Setup and Integration

1. **GitHub Repository Setup**
   - Create a new GitHub repository for hmm_tracer
   - Push the refactored code to the repository
   - Set up branch protection and CI/CD (optional)
   - See [GitHub Setup Plan](github_setup_plan.md) for details

2. **alvahmm Integration**
   - Remove the static alvahmm package
   - Add your forked alvahmm as a Git submodule
   - Set up the development environment for both projects
   - See [alvahmm Integration Plan](alvahmm_integration_plan.md) for details

### Phase 2: Feature Development

1. **Cell Body Detection**
   - Implement cell body detection algorithms
   - Create connection algorithms for cell bodies and neurites
   - Add visualization and analysis capabilities
   - See [Cell Body Detection Plan](cell_body_detection_plan.md) for details

2. **Improved Visualization**
   - Enhance visualization of traced neurites
   - Add interactive visualization options
   - Create publication-quality figure generation

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile the code to identify bottlenecks
   - Optimize critical sections
   - Implement parallel processing where applicable

### Phase 3: Testing and Documentation

1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Expand unit tests for all modules
   - Add integration tests for the full pipeline
   - Create a test dataset with ground truth annotations

2. **Documentation**
   - Create detailed API documentation
   - Write tutorials and examples
   - Add usage guides for common workflows

3. **Publication and Sharing**
   - Prepare the package for PyPI publication
   - Create a project website or documentation site
   - Write a paper or technical report describing the methods

## Implementation Timeline

### Immediate Next Steps

1. Set up the GitHub repository for hmm_tracer
2. Integrate with your forked alvahmm package
3. Begin implementing the cell body detection feature

### Short-term Goals (1-2 weeks)

1. Complete the basic cell body detection implementation
2. Add tests for the new functionality
3. Create example scripts demonstrating the new features

### Medium-term Goals (1-2 months)

1. Refine and optimize the cell body detection algorithms
2. Improve visualization capabilities
3. Add more comprehensive documentation

### Long-term Goals (3+ months)

1. Add more advanced features (e.g., time-lapse analysis)
2. Optimize for large-scale datasets
3. Prepare for publication and wider distribution

## Development Workflow

We'll follow a systematic approach to development:

1. **Planning**: Create detailed plan files for each feature or component
2. **Implementation**: Develop the code according to the plans
3. **Testing**: Write tests to verify functionality
4. **Documentation**: Document the code and create examples
5. **Review**: Review the code and plans for completeness
6. **Iteration**: Refine based on feedback and testing

## Thought File Management

We'll use the following system for managing thought files:

1. Create a plan file for each major component or feature
2. Mark completed plans with the `_complete` suffix
3. Update plans as needed, removing the `_complete` suffix if significant changes are made
4. Re-add the `_complete` suffix once the updates are fully addressed

## Conclusion

This development plan provides a roadmap for the continued development of the HMM Tracer project. By following this plan, we'll create a robust, well-documented package for axon tracing and cell body detection in microscopy images.
