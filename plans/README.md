# HMM Tracer Project Plans

This directory contains planning documents for the HMM Tracer project. These plans outline the design, implementation, and testing approaches for various components and features of the project.

## Plan File Organization

- Plan files are named according to their purpose (e.g., `feature_name_plan.md`)
- Completed plans are marked with the `_complete` suffix (e.g., `feature_name_plan_complete.md`)
- A plan may be marked as complete but still receive updates later

## Using Plan Files

1. **Creating a New Plan**: Use the `plan_template.md` as a starting point for new plans
2. **Updating Plans**: Add new information to plans as the project evolves
3. **Completing Plans**: Mark a plan as complete by adding the `_complete` suffix when all points have been addressed
4. **Referencing Plans**: Reference plan files in commit messages and documentation

## Plan File Status

A plan file can have one of the following statuses:

- **Draft**: Initial planning stage, subject to significant changes
- **In Progress**: Being actively worked on
- **Complete**: All points have been addressed (marked with `_complete` suffix)
- **Archived**: No longer relevant but kept for historical purposes
